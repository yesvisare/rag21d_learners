Course projects and real-world work are different animals.\n\n**Legacy Code vs. Greenfield Projects:**\n- In this course: Built everything from scratch, clean slate, your architectural choices\n- In real jobs: You'll inherit 3-year-old RAG systems with deprecated libraries, poor documentation, and technical debt\n- **What this means:** You'll spend more time understanding existing systems than building new ones\n- **First 2-3 months:** Reading code, not writing much\n\n**Solo Building vs. Team Collaboration:**\n- In this course: You made all decisions\n- In real jobs: Tech leads, data teams, DevOps, product managers, security—all have input\n- **What this means:** Consensus and communication matter more than pure technical skill\n- **You'll spend:** 40-50% of time in meetings, code reviews, discussions\n\n**Technical Ideals vs. Business Constraints:**\n- In this course: \"Let's use GPT-4 for best quality\"\n- In real jobs: \"We have $500/month LLM budget. Find a cheaper solution or explain the ROI\"\n- **What this means:** Perfect is the enemy of shipped. You'll build \"good enough\" solutions\n\n**Shipping Once vs. Maintaining Forever:**\n- In this course: Built projects, they worked, moved on\n- In real jobs: You're on-call for that RAG system at 2am when it breaks\n- **What this means:** 50-70% of time maintaining and debugging, not building new\n\n---\n\n### First Job Success Tips\n\nTo succeed in your first AI role:\n\n1. **Expect 3-6 months to feel productive** - This is normal\n2. **Ask questions aggressively** - \"Stupid\" questions now prevent disasters later\n3. **Document everything** - Write down tribal knowledge\n4. **Ship small, ship often** - Get feedback early, iterate publicly\n5. **Focus on business impact** - The system that saves $10K/month beats the technically beautiful one\n\n**Remember:** Portfolio projects prove you can build. First job proves you can work on a team, navigate ambiguity, and deliver under constraints.\n\n---",

Build for 3-4 weeks BEFORE next course\n\n**🚫 Mistake #2: Building in Private**\n- **Symptom:** Zero portfolio visibility, hidden GitHub repos\n- **Solution:** Make repos public, post on LinkedIn, share weekly learnings\n\n**🚫 Mistake #3: Perfectionism Paralysis**\n- **Symptom:** Never shipping, endless refining\n- **Solution:** 2-3 week deadline per project. Ship with \"Known Limitations\"\n\n**🚫 Mistake #4: Jumping to Advanced Topics**\n- **Symptom:** Weak fundamentals, can't debug issues\n- **Solution:** Master basics deeply first. Can you explain embeddings simply?\n\n**🚫 Mistake #5: Learning in Isolation**\n- **Symptom:** No network, no referrals, struggling alone\n- **Solution:** Join communities, comment daily, ask questions, help others\n\n---\n\n### Weekly Review Checklist\n\nUse this every week to stay on track:",

   "source": "### Path 1: Framework Mastery (LangChain/LlamaIndex)\n\n**Overview:** Master high-level frameworks that abstract away RAG complexity. Build applications 5-10x faster.\n\n#### Decision Card: Framework Mastery\n\n**✅ BENEFITS**\n- Build RAG applications 5-10x faster with production-tested abstractions\n- Join largest AI dev community (100K+ developers)\n- Access pre-built components for agents, tools, memory\n- Strong job market demand (60% of AI job posts mention LangChain/LlamaIndex)\n- Fastest path to shipping products\n\n**❌ LIMITATIONS**\n- Abstractions can mask inefficiencies—you may build slow systems without understanding why\n- Framework churn is high (breaking changes every 2-3 months)\n- Temptation to use without understanding internals\n- Limited to framework's design decisions\n- Need to relearn when frameworks evolve or fall out of favor\n\n**💰 COST**\n- **Time:** 4-6 weeks to proficiency (15-20 hours/week)\n- **Money:** Frameworks free, courses $50-200\n- **Complexity:** Medium—easier than from scratch, harder than expected\n- **Maintenance:** High—framework updates require constant learning\n- **Opportunity cost:** Less time for ML fundamentals or system design\n\n**🤔 USE WHEN**\n- Goal is to ship products quickly (startup environment or side projects)\n- Comfortable with abstraction layers\n- Need to collaborate with team using these tools\n- Targeting AI engineer roles (not ML engineer or researcher)\n- Have 15+ hours/week for 4-6 weeks\n- Enjoy rapid prototyping over deep understanding\n\n**🚫 AVOID WHEN**\n- Goal is ML research or PhD → focus on fundamentals instead\n- Need to optimize costs/performance → abstractions hide optimization opportunities\n- Working at scale (millions of queries/day) → need custom solutions\n- Prefer stability over cutting-edge → frameworks change too fast\n- Want deep ML understanding → focus on Path 2 or foundational ML courses\n- Limited time (<10 hours/week) → master Path 2 first",

What's my career goal? (Startup founder? FAANG engineer? Consultant? Researcher?)\n2. How much time do I realistically have? (10 hrs/week? 20? 40?)\n3. What's my financial runway? (Can I afford 6-12 months of learning?)\n4. Do I prefer depth or breadth?\n5. Am I comfortable with research papers and math?\n\nWrite down your answers before proceeding.\n\n---",
