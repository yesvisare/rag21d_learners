RAG systems reduce hallucination by 60-80% by grounding LLM responses in actual documentation.
Improving RAG accuracy requires careful tuning of retrieval strategies, reranking, and context preparation.
Query expansion generates alternative phrasings to capture more relevant documents from the index.
Hybrid search combines dense embeddings for semantics with sparse BM25 for exact keyword matching.
Cross-encoder reranking significantly improves result quality but adds 50-100ms latency per query.
Production RAG systems handle 1,000+ documents efficiently with proper indexing and caching strategies.
Namespace organization in Pinecone allows logical separation of document collections by project or domain.
Alpha tuning adjusts the balance between dense and sparse retrieval based on query type characteristics.
Factual queries benefit from higher dense weights (alpha=0.7) to leverage semantic understanding.
How-to queries need balanced retrieval (alpha=0.5) combining exact terms with conceptual matches.
Context deduplication prevents redundant information from consuming valuable token budget in prompts.
Response latency in RAG systems typically ranges 200-400ms including retrieval, reranking, and generation.
Source attribution builds user trust by showing which documents contributed to each generated answer.
Token window constraints limit context size, requiring smart chunking and prioritization strategies.
Query classification into six types enables type-specific optimization of retrieval and prompting.
Troubleshooting queries require lower alpha (0.3) to prioritize exact error messages and technical terms.
BM25 sparse encoding excels at matching specific product names, error codes, and technical identifiers.
Metadata filtering on date ranges, categories, or access levels refines retrieval before semantic scoring.
Graceful fallbacks handle missing keys, empty results, and API failures without crashing the pipeline.
Decision cards help teams assess whether RAG architecture fits their use case before implementation.
